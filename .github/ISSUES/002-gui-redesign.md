Title: GUI redesign — make UI match mock and improve UX

Description:
The current GUI is functional but not polished. The user requested a dark rounded window mock with a large mic graphic on the left and status + vertical toggles on the right. Also improve animation, toggle visibility, and feedback for STT states.

Suggested tasks:

- Implement rounded window frame / dark theme.
- Center and scale mic animation to new canvas size.
- Improve checkbox visibility and default states (default all checked).
- Add persistent Result area and clearer stage indicators.

Priority: Medium
